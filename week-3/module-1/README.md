# Using Hardhat 

### What I learnt through this module:

* Creating a Hardhat project and configuring it.
* Creating smart contracts.
* Writing tests for the contracts using Ethers.js and Waffle.
* Debugging Solidity using Hardhat Network (a local Ethereum network).
* Deploying the contracts to Hardhat Network and Ethereum testnets.
